# Avatar: The Second Age Enhancements
Module intended to provide minor enhancements for the [StarWarsFFG and Genesys FoundryVTT system](https://github.com/StarWarsFoundryVTT/StarWarsFFG) without including any copyrighted content to support the Avatar: Second Age core rule book.

## Scope

This module is designed to supplement the
[StarWarsFFG and Genesys FoundryVTT system](https://github.com/StarWarsFoundryVTT/StarWarsFFG).  The enhancements included are aimed at providing sane defaults for common workflows which aren't technically part of the core rules within Genesys, such as: macros, Avatar: Second Age actors and such.  

**Note**: We do not aim to include any core-rule features. If it's something the FFG Star Wars system defines in rules, we believe the system module should support it.  This module is about enhancing the play experience, not implementing the rules. Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra are trademarks of Viacom.

## Enhancements
### Features
* Automatically renames actors in combat (to generic "PC" and "NPC" slots)
* Provides tips on how to spend combat dice results

### Utilities
* Includes the most common macros from the Wiki

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### What about copyright?
Creating a module like this is tricky - there's a fine line between helpful tweaks and straight-up including copyrighted assets. As such:
* We specifically exclude any content to which we do not have rights
* We provide licensing information for all third party assets we include
